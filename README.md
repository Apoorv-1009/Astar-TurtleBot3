## Part 01: 2D Implementation
The astar_apoorvthapliyal#1.py code demonstrates path planning using the A* algorithm in a 2D grid environment and Gazebo. The algorithm finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node while avoiding obstacles.

### How to provide inputs

1. Follow the prompts to enter the following sample inputs:
- Clearance (mm): 10
- RPM1 (Rounds-Per-Minute): 50
- RPM2 (Rounds-Per-Minute): 100
- Start x position (mm): 230
- Start y position (mm): 1769
- Start angle (theta): 0
- Goal x position (mm): 5769
- Goal y position (mm): 1769
2. If the start/goal happens to be in the obstacle space, then the user will be repromted to enter the start/goal till it is not in the obstacle space
6. The script will visualize the path planning process and display the result.

### Libraries/Dependencies Used

- NumPy: For numerical computations and array manipulation.
- OpenCV (cv2): For image processing tasks such as drawing and displaying images.
- heapq: Provides functions for heap queue operations (used for priority queue implementation in A* algorithm).
- time: For calculating time taken by code to complete execution
- math: For mathematical operations

### Description

1. **Action Set Definition:** Defines each action (movement) in the grid.

2. **Mathematical Representation of Free Space:** Defines the canvas and obstacles in the grid environment. Obstacles are represented by filled polygons.

3. **Generate the Graph and Check for Goal Node:** Implements A* algorithm to search for the optimal path from the start node to the goal node while avoiding obstacles.

4. **Optimal Path Generation:** Retrieves the optimal path from the parent dictionary generated by A* algorithm.

5. **Represent the Optimal Path:** Visualizes the start and goal nodes, visited nodes, and the optimal path on the canvas. This visualization is performed in an animated manner, showing the progression of the algorithm.

### Note
- The script generates an output video (`astar.mp4`) showing the progression of the algorithm and the final result.
- a_star_apoorvthapliyal#1.ipynb notebook is simply for testing.
